Project of a Match-3 game made in Unity using C# language. Game contains over 200 levels with a lot of different types of tiles, boosters, combos, bomb types. Main menu allows to choose a levels (if unlocked), leave a comment/rate on Google Play, like a facebook page, edit settings, and go to shop. In the shop you can buy different kinds of boosters in different packages. After choosing a level information with an environmental fact appears on the screen. When the level is ready you can choose one of the three pre game boosters and then you can start a level. To complete a level you must score at least one star and complete all level objectives. In the game I implemented Unity Ads - baner ads, video ads, rewarded ads. In the shop you can buy an option to remove ads. If you are out of moves and connected to internet you can watch an add to get 5 extra moves.
