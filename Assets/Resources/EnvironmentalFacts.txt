If Earths history is squeezed into one year, modern human has existed for 37 minutes and used up a third of Earths natural resources in the last 0.2 seconds (theworldcounts.com, 2020). 
Every year we extract almost 90 billion tons of biomass, fossil energy, metal and minerals from the earth - more than 11 tons for every single person on the planet. And for people in the western world this number is much higher (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
In the 47 years between 1970 and 2015, human consumption of Earths natural resources more than tripled. Our use of natural resources is expected to continue its growth and more than double from 2015 to 2050 (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The “material footprint” is an indicator of the amount of raw materials used to satisfy our consumption. As you read this we are draining the Earth for fish & seafood, metal, wood, minerals, energy and so on (theworldcounts.com, 2020). 
The growing world population - and especially the growing population of consumers - is the main driver of the increased demand for natural resources. So far, innovation and technological developments have not been able to break this link (theworldcounts.com, 2020). 
Out of the almost 90 billion tons of resources extracted from Earth every year, 22.5 billion tons are biomass. Biomass includes fruit, cereal, meat, wood, fish and so on. Some of the consequences of human extraction of biomass are truly alarming (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Rich nations may need to cut the use of natural resources by as much as 90 percent to ensure environmental and social sustainability. At the moment, the world is moving in the opposite direction (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
How do we cut down our use of nature? Well, according to the UN by decoupling population and economic growth from resource use. In other words, we need to find happiness without consuming the planet (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Global average per capita income is growing and so is the impact per capita. Our use of natural resources will more than double from 2015 to 2050 though the world population will “only” increase by a third in this period (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
There is light at the end of the tunnel. Per capita impact on the planet is growing slower than the economic growth indicating that it is possible to have growth without a negative impact on the planet. But is is a very dim light and for now not merely enough to save the planet. Major changes are needed (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Innovation and technological developments are needed to break the link between human prosperity and footprint on the planet. Our current technology simply cannot keep up with population growth (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Natural ecosystems are losing their ability to adjust. They are reaching critical thresholds beyond which they will no longer be able to recover. According to the American ecologist, professor Jared Diamond, we are approaching such tipping points in 2050 at the latest beyond which it will no longer be possible to save the Earth (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago and modern humans have existed for about 315,000 years. According to a study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), more than a third of Earth’s natural resources have been destroyed by humans in just thirty years (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Not only has humanity used up a third of nature’s resources. We keep on consuming them. At an increasing rate. Today we need about 1.75 planets to provide the resources for our consumption and absorb our waste. By 2030, we will need 2 planets. We only have one (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Ecological overshoot occurs when humanity’s demand on nature exceeds what ecosystems can supply. In other words, when we use more natural resources than the biosphere can regenerate. Earth Overshoot Day is the day of the year when we have used up one year’s supply of “nature” (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
In 2019 “Earth Overshoot Day” was July 29 meaning that from this day humanity lives beyond the ecological capacity of planet earth. Every year the day arrives a little earlier… In 2012 the day was August 22, in 2009 it was September 25 (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The ecological footprint measures how fast we consume natural resources and generate waste compared to how fast nature can generate new resources and absorb our waste (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The human impact on Earth is so massive that it has resulted in the formal denomination of a new geological Epoch: The Anthropocene Epoch. Alternatively: The Human Age or the Era of Man (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Current overuse is due to our consumption of goods and services. The extraction, production, distribution, use, and disposal of the stuff we buy. As a consumer you have the possibility to make a positive difference (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
In 2019, about 43.1 billion tons of CO2 from human activities were emitted into the atmosphere. This was an all time high, breaking the previous record from 2018. The emissions could form a giant “CO2 cube” measuring 30 km on each side (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
A greenhouse gas is capable of absorbing infrared radiation, thereby trapping heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. This is known as the greenhouse effect and ultimately leads to global warming. CO2 is one of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
How big reductions in CO2-emissions are needed to limit the rise in global temperatures? According to the UN Environment Programme, emissions must fall by 25 % before 2030 to keep increases within 2 degrees by 2100. 55 % reductions before 2030 are needed to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
CO2-emissions from human activities have caused the concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere to go up from around 275 parts per million (ppm) before the industrial revolution to over 410 in 2020. A 50 % increase (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The average global temperature in 2019 was about 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. And temperatures keep going up. With current trends, there is little hope to limit increases to 2 degrees (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Greenhouse gases trap heat and make the planet warmer. CO2 is a greenhouse gas but there are many other, and stronger greenhouse gases than CO2 (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Methane: A very powerful greenhouse gas that is 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide. The levels of methane have increased 170 % since the industrial revolution (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Carbon dioxide: The main contribution to the greenhouse effect by human activities (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Deforestation is a main contributor to climate change and the second largest human source of CO2-emissions after fossil fuel combustion. Emissions from deforestation are somewhat “indirect” because deforestation results in less CO2 absorbed by trees (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Deforestation accounts for 10-15 % of CO2-emissions globally. The number used to be closer to 20 % but has gone down mainly because carbon emissions from fossil fuels have gone up - not because the level of deforestation has decreased (theworldcounts.com, 2020). 
Forests store over a trillion tons of the world’s carbon. That's almost 42 % of all CO2-emissions caused by human activity in the pre-industrial era (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The meat industry (also referred to as the livestock sector) is responsible for about 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. That means that the industry produces more emissions than the transportation industry - meaning all cars, planes, trains and ships combined (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
And there are no signs that this will change: Global consumption of meat is expected to rise 75 % by 2050 (compared to 2011) and global demand for livestock products in general could double by 2050 (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The main sources of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock are: the production and processing of feed and methane from digestion (farts!) (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Permafrost means that the ground remains permanently frozen and permafrost soils holds a lot of CO2 - almost 1.6 trillion tons (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Disturbingly, the Arctic permafrost is thawing. And much faster than earlier expected. Permafrost in the Canadian Arctic is thawing 70 years earlier than predicted, indicating that the global climate crisis is accelerating even faster than scientists had feared (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
As the production of energy from fossil fuels is the main cause of CO2-emissions, the world needs to start generating energy from renewable sources. And quickly. This is possible as the sun could power the world many times over! (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Meat has a much higher “energy footprint” than any other food. It takes 75 times more energy to produce meat than corn. And it takes an area of vegetation 7 times the size of the EU to produce food for the cattle and other livestock animals in Europe (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
It takes an estimated 2-3 calories of fossil fuel to produce 1 calorie of protein from soybeans, corn, or wheat. For beef it takes 54 calories of fuel to produce 1 calorie of protein (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
One hectare of rice or potato cropland can feed between 19 and 22 people in one year. For beef or lamb one hectare can feed only 1 or 2 people. But cropland is shrinking. By 2050, we may have less than 0.1 hectares per person on the planet (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Almost HALF of the world’s harvest is fed to animals. Globally, 90 percent of the ever-increasing soybean harvest goes for animal feed (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The ground water level is falling dramatically in China, India and the USA. This is serious - especially as these 3 countries currently produce half of the world’s food (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Worldwide, cattle and other livestock animals generate an estimated 13 billion tons of waste every year. This is the weight of the Eiffel tower every 24 seconds. The problem of what to do with this waste is increasing (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Surprisingly, the burps and farts by cattle and other livestock animals account for 18 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. That's more than the total emissions from the transport sector (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
One of the most common pesticides used on cocoa in West Africa is lindane, a toxic organochlorine cousin of DDT. Not exactly healthy for the farmers, and not healthy for you either if there are pesticide residues in the harvest (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Organic fair trade chocolate is widely available! No pesticides, and often with a richer taste. Look for these when you shop for chocolate (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Half of all aluminium cans are recycled. That's a total of 105 million cans a year. This is enough to build more than 70,000 Boeing 737 airplanes - almost 10 times the total number of 737's ever build! (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Since 1946 industrial farms have been using antibiotics to livestock feed. This was done to increase the profit for the farmers as studies showed the animals gained weight more efficiently and grew faster (theworldcounts.com, 2020). 
According to the Danish Food and Drug Administration, 88% of the pigs in conventional piggeries carry the MRSA bacteria, whereas in the organic piggeries the percent is as low as 6% (theworldcounts.com, 2020). 
Since the 1980 the use of antibiotics added to feed for industrial livestock production has exploded. In the United States from 1985 to 2001, antibiotic usage rose with 50% - only in poultry production. As many as 80% of the total antibiotics used in the United states are given to farming animals (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Food production requires water. In the United States, food waste accounts for 25 percent of the country's water use. Throwing food away is like leaving the tap running in the country where the food was produced - and an increasing number of areas are suffering from water shortages (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Some people show alarming levels of ignorance with regard to food-related issues. In a survey, most urban consumers who were interviewed did not realize that meat and dairy come from living animals that use natural resources (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The food wasted by the United States and Europe alone could feed the world 3 times over (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Soft plastic toys may contain more than 40 percent phthalates by weight. Phthalates have been linked to a number of reproductive health effects, including reduced fertility, miscarriage, birth defects, abnormal sperm counts, and testicular damage, as well as to liver and kidney cancer (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
We use more than 2 pieces of paper for everyone on Earth every single hour. Demand for paper is expected to double between 2005 and 2030 (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
In the USA, Japan, and Europe an average person uses between 250 and 300 kilos of paper every year. In India the figure is 5 kilos, and in some countries it is less than 1 kilo. If everyone used 200 kilos there would be no trees left (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
It takes 10 liters of water to produce a single A4-sheet of paper. The pulp and paper industry is the single largest industrial consumer of water in Western countries (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Producing 1 kilo of paper requires 2-3 times its weight in trees. Paper can be recycled, yet 55 percent of the global paper supply comes from newly cut trees (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Each ton of recycled paper can avoid the use of 17 trees; 1,440 liters of oil; 2.3 cubic meters of landfill space; 4,000 kilowatts of energy and 26,500 liters of water (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The difference between using new toilet paper and toilet paper made from recycled materials is 400 million trees, 660 million tons of water, and 45 million tons of oil. Recycled toilet paper and home tissue products are widely available (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Worldwide, we buy furniture corresponding to the total economic output of Norway - 12,000 US dollars every second. All those pieces of furniture require enormous amounts of trees, cotton and other materials (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The use of energy in all of the world's households is equivalent to burning off 50 tons of oil every second. But it is not only oil. We also burn a lot of coal (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The potential for renewable energy is large. For example, already by 2015 the Sahara desert could provide European households with sun energy (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Take telephones. These are made from as many as 42 different minerals, including arsenic, cadmium, lead, aluminum, beryllium, copper, gold, limestone, silica, silver, and wollastonite. The average PC requires 240 kilos of fossil fuels and 22 kilos of chemicals to produce (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Prior to World War II, the perfume industry used only natural methods and oils to make fragrances. But due to the revolution in the chemical industry, more than 7,600 ingredients are used today - and the number keeps growing (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Some chemicals build up in your body and interact with each other. This chemical experiment inside your body has been linked to really scary stuff such as hormone disruption, cancer, and allergy (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
29 million tons of cotton are produced a year. The same as 29 t-shirts for everyone on Earth. But the consumption of cotton varies a lot. In some Western countries we use an amount of cotten that would corresponds to more than 100 t-shirts per person (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
More chemical pesticides are used for cotton than for any other crop. Cotton accounts for 16 percent of global insecticide releases. 60 percent of the world’s cotton is used for clothing and another 35 percent for home furnishing (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Cotton pesticides can prevent individual nerve cells from communicating with one another. Effects also include impaired memory, severe depression, disruption of the immune system, paralysis and death (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Prints on clothing is typically made from PVC, phthalates and other harmful chemicals. Up to 8,000 chemicals can be used in the production and processing of textiles - for dyeing, treating, printing and finishing (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
It takes 10,000 liters of water to produce 1 kilo of cotton, meaning it takes about 2,700 liters to make 1 cotton t-shirt. When you buy clothing you therefore “use” water from wherever the cotton was produced (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Organic fair trade cotton is free of chemical pesticides and is produced with respect for the workers' rights and safety. Global production is still small but has increased 5-fold over a period of just 4 years. Organic cotton is now grown in over 22 countries around the globe (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
At one Egyptian farm project, organic cultivation has boosted cotton yields by more than 30 percent, and the fiber is processed into textiles without any synthetic chemicals. In Uganda, organic cotton farms are more productive than the conventional farms (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Hemp has been used to make clothes for 12,000 years and is more robust than cotton so it does not need large volumes of chemicals. You can get three times more hemp fibre from the same area compared to cotton. Hemp also requires less water and energy than any other fibre - and it’s cheaper than cotton (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The transport sector burns most of the world's petroleum and is one of the largest sources of global greenhouse gas emissions. It's also heavy on air pollution (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Cars are one of the most recycled products in the world - about 85 percent of all the materials are reused. Other industries could learn much from this (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
One transatlantic flight takes more than 400 kilo of fuel per passenger and emits about 4000 kilos of CO2 equivalents. On short distances, trains emit 10 times less CO2 than planes (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Every second a plane takes off somewhere in the world. The total number of aircrafts is expected to grow from 18,000 in 2006 to 44,000 in 2030 (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
An average golf course in a tropical country, for example, uses as much water as 60,000 rural villagers. It also uses 1500 kilos of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides per year (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Eco-tourism also has an active social dimension. It seeks to benefit local communities by giving them control over how the tourism develops, and by helping locals to use their lands and resources in more sustainable ways (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
97 percent of climate scientists agree that there is sufficient evidence that human activity is warming the planet. It’s extremely likely that global warming trends over the past century are due to human activities, as they put it (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Limiting global warming to 1.5°C by 2100 is still possible but the possibility is quickly fading. It would require an immediate and very significant reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions with a 55 % reduction from 2020 to 2030 (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Climate change affects the world food system for instance through changes in global precipitation patterns. Crop production is likely to be negatively affected by climate change - especially in low-latitude countries (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Global vegetable production, yields could fall by 35 % globally by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions remain at current levels due to water scarcity (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Ironically, as sea levels are rising, water shortages will increase as a result of global warming. Droughts and heat waves will become more common. In Africa alone, up to 250 million people could be exposed to increased water stress with yields from rain-fed agriculture reduced up to 50 percent (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Rising global temperatures contribute to the loss of habitat. Potential consequences include the complete loss of the world’s coral reefs and the Amazon rainforest. Together with the loss of habitat, climate change is a major threat to biodiversity and leads to a loss of species (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
The melting of the ice sheets of Antarctic and Greenland could eventually make sea levels rise as much as 14 meters (46 feet) making large parts of the world uninhabitable and make feeding a global population much larger than today extremely challenging if not impossible (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Tipping point theories predict that temperature increases will create self-reinforcing effects that will bring global warming completely out of control. According to an article in Nature in November 2019, evidence is mounting for the existence of critical tipping points (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
Coral reefs are very sensitive to increases in temperatures and the warming of the world’s oceans have led to a process known as coral bleaching, which is the first step to losing coral reefs (theworldcounts.com, 2020). 
A tipping point is projected to happen in case of a 2°C temperature increase in which case a staggering 99% of tropical corals reefs are projected to be lost (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
A vicious circle is taking place in the Amazon: We are cutting down the rainforest which is contributing to global warming as deforestation is a major contributor to CO2-emissions. At the same time, climate change is destabilising the Amazon rainforest further (theworldcounts.com, 2020). 
Permafrost is when the ground remains below freezing point all the time. And frozen soils locks up carbon. A lot of carbon. Soils in the Arctic permafrost region holds double the amount of carbon as the entire atmosphere. That’s almost 1.6 trillion tons of CO2 (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
t is very difficult to exaggerate the seriousness of the situation. We are clearly approaching several critical tipping points that would set off a series of self-reinforcing effects spinning global warming completely out of control (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
According to the American ecologist professor, Jared Diamond, critical tipping points will kick in  by 2050 at the latest beyond which it will no longer be possible to save the Earth (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
If no action is taken to mitigate climate change, global temperatures could increase by a massive 5 degrees by 2100 (theworldcounts.com, 2020).
